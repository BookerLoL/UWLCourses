# Notes
## Introduction
- HCI, human computer interaction
    - designing usable, reliable, efficient front-end 
    - **design, implementation, evaluation, evolution** of user interfaces
- Good UI
    - attractive (first impression => best)
    - terminology familiar with user
    - seperated from application
    - meaningful error msgs
    - easy to use and understand
    - consistent and unambigious
    - provide as much help (tutorials/help systems/manuals)
- UI Software
    - event driven
- design models support consttruction and help validate UI
    - GUI <=> Event handler <=> Shared info 
    - Interface Obj <=> Event handler <=> Control Obj <=> Model obj

## GUI Controls
- Text field
    - user input on **single line**
    - passwords should be hidden
- Text Area (display area)
    - displaying text
    - scroll bar
- Label
    - display name/text/message  (purpose of another GUI Control)
    - banner/logo
    - display message (cleared afterwards)
- Buttons
    - **associated with button**
        - invoke simple action
            - complex -> sequence and coherent
    - uniquely named
- Toggle Button
    - strictly alternate between two dinstinct actions
        - on / off, lock / unlock, change colors of icons
- Radio button
    - select only 1 value from group
- Check box
    - selecting 1+ from group
- Drop-down box / Combo box
    - select 1 entry from list
    - saves space
- List box
    - select 1+ entry from list
    - usually comes with slider
- Menu
    - list of actions to invoke when selected
        - navigate / execute / display / parameters
    - header, and sub-menus
    - display all relevant stuff that relate
    - levels and items usually indirectly proportional
        - align items to task at hand
            - normal alignment: top -> bottom, left justified
            - horitonzal alignment
    - separate choices
        - sequence of occurrence, freq of occur, importance, semantic similarity, alphanumerical
        - space/lines betweeen groups of choices 
        - menu titles catchy & appropriate
    - Types
        - Pull down
        - Context menu (based on current state/context)
            - usually right click
        - Hierarchical menu (0+ sub-menus)
    - Use if: ideal, helpful, and enhancement

## UI Design Principles
- Accessibility
    - support disability too
- Compatiability
    - user: dev consider diff groups
    - product: GUI merge with app domain
    - task: approp tasks for selected users
- Aesthetically Pleasing
    - first impression = best
    - meaningful contrast
    - align elements 
- Configurability
    - easy to personalize/configure
    - sense of control
- Flexibility
    - easy to integrate with various apps 
    - flexible for diff users
- Forgiveness
    - report appropriate error messages
    - provide appropriate help and motivate user to continue
    - prevent user from making mistake
- Consistency
    - adv
        - user gets correct mental model
        - easy to learn and use
        - similarity across products
    - ex:
        - exit: close window and save app
        - quit: close window and don't save
        - x: exit
        - Ctrl C: copy
    - messages for prompts, feedback, and error messages
        -  accpet / decline for license aggreemnents
        - ok 
        - Pointer error: Null pointer exception on line 1098
    - colors
        - consistent throughout interface
    - layout structures and elements
        - exceptions are acceptable
        - same size, location, etc
    - fonts and pictures
        - same font and size, use consistent format
    - user operations
        - same operations and tasks
    - shortcuts
        - key strokes, abbreviations, macro facilities
    - Informative feedback
        - confirm user action as much as possible
            - prompt / pop-up windows
                - helps to prevent mistakes
        - no need to display message if user closes window
            - unless they don't save ?
        - descriptive and friendly error messages
- Error Prevent
    - protect user from introducing errors
    - verify correct seq actions (force back button)
    - provide "undo"
## Direct Manipulation System
- representation of objs, reversible/incremental/rapid action and feedback
- Goals
    - feeling of interface mastery
    - high deg competence in performing tasks
    - easy to learn and move to advance features
- Challenges
    - too much space (maybe)
    - need to know icons and grpahical elements
    - standardization of visual representation (maybe)
- Icon Choosing
    - represents action/obj
    - limit amt
    - visible and standout from background
    - additional info: tool tip, etc
- Metaphors
    - symbol/icon = realworld entity
    - Folder  with folder icon
- Advantages
    - beginners learn quickly
        - tutorial optional
        - next level quickly
    - users confidence using it
- Examples
    - Home alarm, Tele-medicine, flight simulators

## User Profiles
- Characterization of user/set of users
    - Differences in background knowledge (domain vs UI concepts)
        - level of training, frequency of usage, ability to interpret error messages
- Difficulties 
    - Not predicting user expctations
    - Hard to assess what knowledge a particular user has
# Starting Point
- Novice and First-time users
    - Novice
        - May have little domain and UI knowledge
    - First-time
        - may have sufficient domain knowledge but little knowledge of UI
    - Preferable to have
        - dialog boxes
        - small set of easy to remember commands/instructions
        - smal simple set of actions
        - step-by-step tutorial
        - manual
        - on-the-fly example
- Knowledgeable Intermittent Users
    - sufficient domain and UI knowledge
    - Consistency is most important
    - protection from danger when user explore additional features
        - warnings
    - online help system
    - wlel structure menus/instructions
- Expert and Frequent Users
    - experts in domain and UI
    - short, direct, unambiguous messages
    - short cut keys rather than menus
    - tailor user interfaces
- Challenges
    - users gain knowledge in application domain, but not UI concepts, vice versa
- User Centered Design (UCD)
    - user profiles considered
    - provide info about potential users and expectations
    - complexity may suggest various user profiles
- Task profiles
    - identify tasks by each group
    - rank them for each category
    - combine tasks into common groups
    - include shadowing/multiple screen effects to distinguish groups

## Animation
- illusion of motion
- enhance visual feedback
    - grabs attention & explains
- transitions, progress, enhance help system (guide)
- might not be needed, can other ways, irritate expert users, bored
    - provide option to turn off
- use timer at pre-defined intervals (realistic)
- avoid discrete jumps
    - motion blue: shows trace of object moving

## Cosmetics
- emphasize logic/info, differences, attractive
    - maybe unacceptable
- Consider culture, subjective, application, etc
- Problems
    - choosing color, overuse of color, rending color depends on device
- Guidelines
    - monocrome first, colors add conservatively (necessary)
        - Discrimination:  no more than 4, widely spaced on spectrum
            - red, yellow, green, blue, brown
        - Comparative discrimination: no more than 6 or 7 colors
            - orange, yellowish green, cyan, violet, magenta
    - Bright colors for extended reading or older viewers
    - necessary actions
        - warm colors
    - Status / background info
        - green, blue, violet, purple
    - Emphasize
        - bright colors / highlighted colros
    - emphasize separation
        - contrasting colors
    - Choose colors for majority of users
    - Contrast between background and foreground
    - Same color for similar actions
    - Provide facility to change colors
- Fonts
    - Use propritionze to size of UI element
    - readability
    - Styles used only when necessary / emphasize
    - colors, contrast with background
- User choice and usability testing
    - preferable to not let users change font
- Metaphors 
    - symbol/icon represent real world entity
        - check with users
