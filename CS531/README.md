# CS 531 Intro to Robotics

## Notes

- System Dynamics

  - Systems
    - combination of components acting together to perform specific objective
      - Component
        - Single functioning unit
      - Static
        - system's current output depends only on current input
        - output only changes when input changes
      - Dynamic
        - Output depends on past inputs
          - changes with time
  - Mathematical model

    - mathematical description of system dynamcis characteristics
    - usually have differential equations

  - Linear and nonlinear differential equations
    - Linear, time-invariant
      - linear combination of equations dependent variable and derivatives
      - ex: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\large&space;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{dx}{dt}&space;&plus;&space;10x&space;=&space;0" title="\large \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{dx}{dt} + 10x = 0" />
    - Linear, time-varying
    - Nonlinear
      - contains powers, other functions, products of dependent variables, or it's derivatives
