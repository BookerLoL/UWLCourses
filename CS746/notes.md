## Software Models

Model
: An abstraction to help us understand something

**Characteristics of Model**

1) Abstraction
    - only most important things modeled
2) Expressiveness
    - express some property of interest
3) Implementable: 
    - impl with same properties 
4) Relationships: 
    - if 1+ model for system, must have a relationship 



**Modeling Notation**
- Descriptive (descr intended properties)
- Expressiveness (understand & derive additional properties)
- Analysis (informal/formal/rigirous)
- Refinement


**Modeling Maturity Level**

0) No Specs
    - No specs
    - model: no descr
1) Textual 
    - specs in text
    - model: desc in text/no descr
2) Text and Diagrams
    - specs in text & diagrams
    - models: diagrammatic & weak semantics
3) Models with text
    - Level 2 improved
4) Precise models
    - specs are precise
    - model has precise notation & more semantics
    - possible to automate refinement of model to sys



**Types of Modeling**

- Data/Info [ER diagrams, Data Flow diagrams]
- Behavior [Use case analysis, FSM, state charts, petri nets, fault tree analysis]
-Architectural [Design patterns, Service-oriented architecture, distributed sys, component-based sys]
-Enterprise modeling [Workflow models, Business processing modeling, Organzational structs]
- Mathematical models [formal specs, safety-critical systems]
