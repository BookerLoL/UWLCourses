# Quiz 2 Questions

## 1) Given the assembly language code shwon below, give the **symbol table** that would be generated by the assembler when assembling this program. The blank symbol table shown below may have more or less rows than needed.
```
.text 0x00400000
lui $t0, 0x0040
zip:
lw $t1, 12($t0)
slt $t2, $t1, $zero
beq $t2, $zero, scp
diff:
andi $t3, $t1, 0xf0
j cd
scp:
ori $t3, $t1, 0xf0
cd:
jr $ra
```

## 2) Hand-execute the assembly program from question 1, and list the register name and final value for each general purpose register that was written by the program. Assume that all general purpose registers have the initial value of zero and that any memory location not shown in the program above also have the value zero initially. 

## 3) Given the following digital logic circuit, write out the truth table that describes the output.
```
A OR NOT B  --> AND NOT B --> Z

```
